# ESP32_Multi-Trigger
This is a Camera WLAN-Remote Trigger based on ESP32 NodeMCU

Pure Parts Price:
- If you buy cheaper from China (Banggood): ca. 9 €
- If you buy from Amazon.de: ca. 16 €
- If you want the OLED Version without Battery: 12 €
- If you want the OLED Version with Battery: 14 € + 18650 Li-Ion Battery

All excluding the Cable

Requirements are:

https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32
and
https://github.com/nhatuan84/esp32-webserver
and if you want to compile the OLED Version
https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-oled-ssd1306

The Libaries go to Documents/Arduino/Libaries
For the Board Description follow the instructions in the Link.

What it actually can do at the moment:

- Simple Intervalometer Trigger (Interval in Seconds, Runtime in Minutes)
- Simple Remote Timer (in Seconds)
- Simple Remote Trigger (single Shot)
- Simple BULB Trigger Start/Stop (can also be used for burst depending on Camera Mode)

What may be possible:

- Triggering from different Sensors (Light, Sound and so on)
- BULB Intervalometer for Star-Trails
- everything you can imagine

What is on my To-Do-List:

- making more Prototypes and create a 3D Printed Housing
- testing Hot-Shoe mounts to get Power from the Camera

WLAN SSID is: Multi-Trigger
WLAN KEY is: 12345678

Power is provided over USB by a Powerbank or by using the Battery Module WeMos ESP32 Board (much bigger).

(can be changed to your needs)

Pins I used on the NodeMCU Version:

32 for Shutter
35 for Focus
33 for Ground (not needed if you solder this pin to GND.)

Pins I used on the WeMos OLED & Battery Version:

26 for Shutter
25 for Focus
27 for Ground (not needed if you solder this pin to GND.)

Don't forget to choose the right Board before compiling.
